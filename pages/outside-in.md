  At the end of November, The World According to Sound will begin Outside In: a series of weekly, live, communal listening events from the quarantined safety of our own homes. Each week, people from around the world will tune in together for over an hour of immersive, spatialized audio, followed by a Q&A with the people who made it.

  One night you may hear music made out of air bubbles trapped in Arctic ice, and the next you'll listen to the most radical documentary NPR ever made (spoiler: it was made a very long time ago). We’ll travel to Iceland, the Hagia Sophia, and be whisked back in time to the streets of 1930’s Cairo. We’ll have acousmatic music, experimental narrative documentary, and all kinds of adventures in found sound.

  Some of the contributors include Matmos, the Kronos Quartet, Leah Reid, Tony Schwartz, Bill Fontana, Jacob Kierkegaard, Irv Teibel, and of course us: The World According to Sound. When you get tickets to a show, you’ll be mailed an eye mask along with instructions on how to listen with pleasure.

  Also, if you are a sound gatherer or maker and would like to submit something for the show,   <a class='email_link' href="mailto:thewatsound@gmail.com" target="_top">email us</a>. The themes for the listening evenings are time, transposition, darkness, bodies, inventions, the wild, and solitude.
