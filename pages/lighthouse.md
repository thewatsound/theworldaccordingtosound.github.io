<h3>Lighthouse For the Blind</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
  In a culture dominated by the visual, the stories of the blind and visually impaired are rarely told, and it’s even more rare for their stories to be told in a medium entirely accessible to them: sound. We spent a year with blind people, recording what they hear and talking to them about how they listen. With support from the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in San Francisco, we are creating a public radio series, podcast, and live communal listening event to bring the blind and sighted together to listen.

    This project is in partnership with <a href="https://lighthouse-sf.org/">the Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired</a> in San Francisco. Together we’re reimagining the world in the rich way blind people experience it every day.
