  Outside In: A Communal Listening Series
</div>
<br>
<p>
  Every Thursday evening starting in December, we’re going to live stream spatialized audio straight to the headphones of people listening together, all around the world. Every attendee will be mailed an eye mask and listening instructions for how to tune into a program made by radio producers, musicians, and sound artists. After each show, we’ll have a live discussion with the people who made the audio.

  Get tickets for individual shows below, or get a highly discounted <a href='https://the-world-according-to-sound.myshopify.com/products/season-pass'>season pass</a> for all eight events.

<p>
  <b>December 3, 2020 — Outside In</b><br>
  The show that started this whole listening series idea: it’s a surround sound escape from the pandemic. We’ll travel from the banality inside our homes, back to a time before the coronavirus, to as far away from earth as possible. Featuring walruses, pulsars, funnels, chimes, hair dryers, and a deconstructed organ, along with Chris’s wayward belt buckle. <b><a href='https://the-world-according-to-sound.myshopify.com/products/general-admission-ticket'>Get tickets</a></b>

<p>
  <b>December 10, 2020 — Transposition*</b><br>
   Just a fancy way of saying that we’re going places. We’ll visit Cairo in the 30s, Berlin in the 40s, New York City in the 50s, an iceberg in Antarctica, Elizabethan England, and forest elephants in the Dzanga Bai.

  <b>December 17, 2020 — Bill Fontana</b><br>
  An evening with an American pioneer in sound-sculptured sensoria. We’ll listen through the expanse of Bill’s career, from the sonic landscape of Australia during a solar eclipse, to the foghorns of San Francisco Bay and the Acqua Vergine aqueducts underneath Rome. Through Bill’s career we get an experiential education in sound recording, projection, and listening.

  <b>January 1, 2021 — Time*</b><br>
  What is time these days anyway? Gyorg Lygeti and John Cage skip rope with Tony Schwartz’s niece, and it turns out the big bang lasted only a little longer than the first two sentences of a radio broadcast FDR made in 1941, but it contains over a hundred meals eaten by Eliot Smoke in a year. This evening celebrates it all, along with the slowest song played as fast as possible, abstracted music boxes, and more metronomes than you can shake a stick at. Kommt Zeit kommt Rat: Only time will tell.

  <b>January 7, 2021 — Radical Radio Documentary</b><br>
  The most ambitious NPR documentary ever made has a lot to say about cult leaders, but also about journalism and objectivity. The subject of this evening is a first-person account of Jonestown delivered by a person who wasn’t there at all. Afterwards, stalwart public radio journalists Chris and Sam will talk with an NPR producer from the network’s early days about the state of American journalism, and why public radio has forgotten that format––and not just content––matters if you want to make something meaningful.

<p>
  <b>January 14, 2021 — Bodies*</b><br>
  There are a lot of ways to make a body produce noise. Jacob Kirkegaard knows a thing or two about that. The sound artist meticulously recorded an autopsy and a body decomposing. This evening’s not all about death though. We’re celebrating the whole range of the live human body: there’s a single voice, a full choir, a musical tooter, popping knees, throbbing brain arteries; but also planetary bodies, bodies of water, and of course a man who claimed his larynx was actually that of a bird’s.

  <b>January 22, 2021 — Matmos</b><br>
  The only pure music show in the series, brought to us by two electronic musicians who make melodies from hospital apparatus and washing machines and bovine uteri. An original work made for The World According to Sound.

</p>
<p>
  <b>January 29, 2021 — Solitude*</b><br>
  Alienation, loneliness, solitude––different sides of a common coin. We’ll hear how lonely a goalkeeper can be, and listen to a man in a car in a field of cows in a 1940s radio play. There will be a contrapuntal train trip up into Canada’s frozen north, along with a journey deep inside the fjords and glaciers of the Scandanavian Arctic Circle.

  <b>February 4, 2021 — TBD</b><br>
  Potentially a quartet known for their sense of chronology
</p>
<br>
<p><b>*</b> These are shows not by a specific person or on one particular work, but a collection of diverse audio pieces orbiting one central theme.</p>
